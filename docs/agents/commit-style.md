# Commit messages

Default for commit messages in this repository: terse, exact Conventional Commits.
Intent over narration; explain why when the diff cannot. This is a formatting
policy, not permission to stage, commit, amend, push, or rewrite history.

## Subject

- Use `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`; scope is optional.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`.
- Prefer 50 characters or fewer; the complete subject has a 72-character hard cap under this default.
- Use imperative verbs, match the project's capitalization, and omit a trailing period.
- For a breaking change, use the Conventional Commits breaking-change marker and explain the break in the body.

## Body and references

Omit the body when the subject fully explains a routine change. Include it for a non-obvious reason, consequences, or necessary issue context.

**Always include a meaningful body for breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations, and reverts.** Explain the relevant impact, migration/recovery action, or reason for reverting. Terse does not mean hiding risk or omitting instructions future maintainers need.

Wrap ordinary body prose at 72 characters and use `-` for bullets. Preserve exact identifiers, URLs, and structured trailer values rather than breaking them to meet a width limit.

Use the configured provider's references and qualify cross-repository references. Use closing semantics only for work fully satisfied by the commit/delivery and permitted by its workflow; otherwise use a non-closing reference. Do not invent issue links or assume GitHub closing keywords work on every provider.

## No filler

Avoid "this commit does," "as requested," first-person narration, redundant filenames, and restating the diff. No decorative emoji unless the project convention requires them. No promotional or generated-by boilerplate.

Preserve required authorship, sign-off, issue, and other trailers exactly as the operator and repository require. Do not invent contributors or suppress a required trailer to make the message shorter. A trailer's structured value is not prose to compress.

## Scope and precedence

Explicit operator instructions and the target repository's governing commit conventions take precedence. Report material conflicts rather than silently overriding them. Keep existing/replayed commits unchanged unless history/message rewriting is separately authorized.

This default applies whether or not Caveman chat mode is active. Stopping that chat mode does not disable commit formatting. Other persisted documents, code comments, PR descriptions, and messages keep their own writing rules.

When asked only to draft a message, return a paste-ready code block. Do not stage or commit as a side effect.

This repository-local copy comes from the installed library's
[shared policy](../../.agents/skills/setup/COMMIT-STYLE.md). Keep its attribution
and applicable license notices when copying it. Do not change global Copilot
configuration as a side effect.

Repository convention: use non-closing issue references and preserve required
trailers. Issue closure and history rewriting require explicit human authority.

## Attribution and license

Adapted from Julius Brussee's MIT-licensed `caveman-commit`, with additional
policy material from Dylan McCurry's `agent-skills`. This copy adapts wording and
links for topo-code and records its non-closing-reference convention. Only the
skills policy is included, not Caveman's separately licensed Engine-linked runtime.
