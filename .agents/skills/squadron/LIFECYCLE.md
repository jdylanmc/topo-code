# Owned agent lifecycle

Owners/workers load this supporting contract before dispatch, return/transfer,
recovery, and retirement. Use caller authority and existing task/session records;
no new skill, controller, permission system, or ledger.
Load the owning contracts without replacing their gates:
[WORKSPACE](../ship/WORKSPACE.md) for Git isolation/Paseo placement when placing agents;
[DELIVERY](../ship/DELIVERY.md) for PR readiness when finishing;
[OBSERVATION](../shepherd/OBSERVATION.md) before PR observation/wakeup changes;
[RECOVERY](../shepherd/RECOVERY.md) for issue-backed Joe continuation.
Keep cadence/episode facts in this custody record.

## Record distinct facts

Record observable facts, evidence pointers, observation times, and explicit
unknowns/capability limits:

- **Identity/role:** repository identity, agent ID, owning parent/return owner,
  assignment bounds, owned PR scopes, authorized actions.
- **Placement:** Git common directory, worktree path, branch/start commit;
  Paseo project/workspace IDs and returned mapping, when used.
- **Delivery:** actual PR state/draft flag, observed source/target refs and
  commits, candidate-specific acceptance/review/check evidence, blockers.
- **Custody:** current scope owner, offered return/transfer, receiver's observed
  state/acknowledgment, remaining duties, next observation when relevant.
- **Runtime:** actual agent status, live child/repair/wakeup ownership, retirement
  result or concrete retention reason, and missing capabilities.

Draft URLs prove progress, not readiness; running/idle/completed/cancelled describes
runtime, not delivery. Sending or sender-authored records cannot prove receiver
observation/acceptance. Receipts alone establish neither truth, human approval,
nor permissions.

## Dispatch, return, and transfer

1. Before launch, reconcile owners/placement. Dispatch stays pending until
   returned agent identity and its first assigned-state observation are confirmed.
2. Workers return complete actual diff/artifacts, candidate IDs, validation/
   acceptance evidence, blockers, and live responsibilities. Bounded returns are
   not full delivery: parents retain integration, independent review, publication,
   and Shepherd handoff.
3. Receivers inspect decisive artifacts/live state and explicitly acknowledge
   accepted scope, observed candidate, remaining duties, and custody. Preserve
   their response. Shepherd handoff requires actual initial PR observation and
   accepted custody—not enqueue/send success, self-authored ownership, or idle status.
4. Senders retain responsibility until acknowledgment, without concurrent
   mutation. Outgoing writers stop before receivers write; no duplicate monitor
   or repair loop. Same-session Shepherd entry still records initial observation
   and role acceptance; naming the skill is insufficient.
5. After acceptance, assign concrete follow-up with owner/resumption condition
   or retire terminal workers below. Reuse retained workers for pending fixes
   when supported, never retain indefinitely for hypothetical work.
   If self-retirement risks the report, explicitly assign its acceptance,
   preservation, and agent retirement to the owning parent.

## Recover before replacing

Cancellation, runtime loss, or unconfirmed handoff invalidates live custody.
Record gaps; reconcile known owners/children, provider refs, partial diffs/commits,
pending permissions, and wakeups. Cancelled parents or idle children do not prove
no work. Preserve partial work; verify stopped writers/monitors before resuming
or replacing owners. Uncertain visibility blocks overlap. Explicitly transfer
each remaining scope; failed sending never justifies stale ownership or duplicate
monitors.

One runtime may host several explicitly assigned Shepherd scopes, each with one
owner and its required cadence. Share execution, not scope, intent, or readiness.
One merge ends only that PR's scope. Active repairs, other PRs, heartbeat waits,
human/permission blockers, or recovery duties can justify idle-agent retention.

## Retire finished owned agents

Owners **must actually archive/retire** clearly terminal owned agents through
supported harness operations after accepting/preserving results and completing/
transferring all duties. Default: action, not cleanup candidates. Read-only
analysis and bounded implementation may end after accepted return; Shepherd ends
only after all owned scopes' actual duties.

Before retirement:
- Verify exact owned agent ID, terminal assignment, preserved evidence, accepted
  return/custody, and no active child, repair, wait, or other PR duty.
- Coordinate run-owned wakeups without disturbing other scopes. Under OBSERVATION,
  cancel/delete and verify only unneeded owned wakeups; terminal fresh-run agents
  do not end future schedule duties.
- Invoke supported retirement; verify archived state or documented active-view
  removal. Uncertain evidence/ownership requires retention, specific reason, and
  next action—not success.

For Paseo, inspect current schemas: `archive_agent` interrupts running agents,
not just visibility. Never archive another owner's agents, all idle agents,
or live monitors for tidiness. When self-archive interrupts reporting, the
acknowledged parent performs/verifies it. Unavailable/denied archival requires
retained ID, capability limit, responsible owner and next action; never guess
APIs, widen permissions, or silently retain forever.

Retirement is **not** project/workspace archival or worktree/branch/evidence
deletion. Paseo workspace archival may delete owned worktrees; never substitute
it. Preserve resources; separately authorized Git cleanup follows WORKSPACE's
preservation checks.

For contract/caller changes, exercise [acceptance scenarios](LIFECYCLE-SCENARIOS.md).
Package/link tests prove reachability, not runtime compliance.
