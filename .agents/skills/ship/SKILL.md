# Ship

Coordinate one feature/specification deliverable into one reviewed, green pull request (PR), current with its latest target, awaiting human signoff under actual [Shepherd](../shepherd/SKILL.md) custody. The deliverable may be one issue or an entire specification with related tickets. The human owns approval and merging. See the human-authored [intent](intent.md).

Follow the common [invocation policy](../setup/INVOCATION.md). Direct human Ship invocation or selection by human-started Joe-mode authorizes the in-scope worktree, implementation, commits, push/PR, review/fixes, and shepherding; do not ask again whether to implement, publish, or shepherd. Explicit narrower requests still constrain the run. Ask for material missing requirements, scope changes, semantic conflicts, destructive probes, or production-data access. Ship, Patch, and Refactor are peer routes, not wrappers around Ship. Multiple Joe-mode deliveries must remain non-overlapping.

Follow [doctrine selection and application](../doctrine/APPLY.md), **requiring `worktrees`** for this delivery. Preserve the operator's preselection for the delivery and its descendants. With no preselection, use [Doctrine's catalog](../doctrine/SKILL.md) to choose relevant IDs for each implementation, integration, and review assignment without reading every body. `code`, `testing`, `sequencing`, `laziness`, and `machine` are candidates, not a mandatory bundle. Each applying worker loads its own selected texts; the code reviewer additionally requires `solid`.

## 1. Ground the delivery

Read repository guidance, the request, spec, tickets, relevant code, and any existing PR. Resolve the repository, hosting provider, target branch, acceptance conditions, non-goals, and agreed test seams. Use existing tracker configuration when available; ask for missing decisions instead of inventing requirements.

Do not demand a readiness label or reject the assignment just because a ticket is marked blocked. Inspect actual prerequisites, start work that can proceed, and report concrete blockers. Do not bypass dependencies or weaken acceptance to keep moving.

For a ticket graph, record each task, its prerequisites, and its acceptance conditions. Surface missing dependencies, cycles, or ambiguous edges before scheduling affected tasks. Stay within the agreed deliverable; do not sweep in the rest of the backlog.

Inspect local changes and branch state. Preserve unrelated work. Apply the loaded `worktrees` doctrine using the [workspace procedure](WORKSPACE.md), respecting suitable existing isolation and its owner. Do not deliver from the default branch. Record the starting commit for review; it is not a prerequisite packet for resuming a PR.

Keep a short progress record in the harness session workspace: task states, worker identities/worktrees, integrated commits, checks, decisions, and the PR URL when known. Reconcile it with current Git/provider state after interruption rather than replaying completed work.

Keep the scoped doctrine selection and per-worker required IDs, source/digest references, and load/application reports with that record. Pass them to fixes, review, and Shepherd; do not lose operator choices at an agent boundary or assume selection means a worker has read the doctrine.

Load and execute [LIFECYCLE](../squadron/LIFECYCLE.md): verified dispatch
placement, receiver-observed acceptance, cancellation recovery, and actual
terminal owned-agent retirement. Keep evidence in the same progress record.

Use the [shared delivery packet and finish contract](DELIVERY.md), recording `ship` as owner route and the actual return owner/source/target refs. Every modifying worker uses [changelog](../changelog/SKILL.md); return proposals from isolated workers and serialize consolidation by the integration owner.

## 2. Coordinate implementation

Ship owns scheduling, integration, review, and publication. Give implementation to a worker in a separate context; do not let it approve its own work. If worker or independent-review capability is unavailable, report the limitation and obtain direction rather than silently collapsing the roles.

Use artifact pointers for the spec, tickets, code, and prior findings instead of copying the conversation. A shared exploration worker is useful only when several tasks need the same substantial investigation; save its findings outside the repository and pass the path.

Use the [worker contract](WORKER.md) for dispatch and return: complete bounded task, authorized worktree and harness mapping, actual start/result commits, acceptance evidence, and explicit blockers. Reuse a known worker retained for pending fixes when supported; retire accepted terminal workers under LIFECYCLE. Use configured runtime model preferences; do not revive a separate executor, mandatory model tiers, special ledger tooling, or an alternate finishing route.

Standalone Ship does **not** invoke TDD by default; the operator opts in.
Under Joe-mode and its adapters, prefer paired TDD for features, especially
greenfield, under [TEAM](../joe-mode-paseo/TEAM.md). That feature lane uses two
developer slots; a legacy/non-TDD exception does not make tests or the second
developer useless. Record the exception and useful acceptance work. Do not force
a test-framework retrofit. The caller's slot budget limits the frontier below.

For a standalone single issue, dispatch one implementation worker. Under Joe,
use the selected two-developer feature lane. For a specification:

- Dispatch independent frontier tasks concurrently within the available, authorized capacity. Each worker has its own branch and worktree, created from the latest integrated delivery branch.
- A prerequisite is complete for scheduling only after its work is integrated and its required checks pass, not because a worker said "done" or a tracker issue was closed.
- Serialize tasks that share mutable resources or require a fixed order. Workers do not publish PRs, close tickets, merge into the delivery branch, or dispatch their own reviewers.
- Use one integration worker at a time to reconcile completed branches into the delivery branch. Inspect the resulting diff and run checks for the combined behavior. Do not silently choose between conflicting product intentions.
- Update the task graph after integration and fill newly available capacity. Do not run dependent tasks against a branch missing their prerequisites.

If unfinished tasks remain but none can run and no worker is active, report the blocking dependencies and request direction instead of waiting forever.

Review completed worker scopes with Roast before dependent work relies on them. Batch disjoint completed scopes when the review still covers each task and clearly attributes findings; do not create another reviewer per checklist axis. For a single-task delivery, the whole-deliverable Roast below can serve this purpose without an identical duplicate review. Open acceptance gaps or missing evidence remain explicit blockers, not completed tasks parked behind an agent ruling.

Give each implementer this discipline:

- Trace the entry point through the layers owning the behavior and invariants. Build a complete end-to-end outcome, not an arbitrary one-file patch.
- Reuse existing seams and patterns. Prefer deletion and simplification; refactor within scope when a patch duplicates behavior, weakens ownership, or hides the cause.
- Omit speculative modes, providers, configuration, extensibility, and polish. Add infrastructure or dependencies only when acceptance or correct lifecycle handling requires them; explain material tradeoffs.
- Use [tdd](../tdd/SKILL.md) only when selected above. Otherwise add useful regression/acceptance coverage without forced test-first order. Run focused tests and typechecking; report missing proof honestly.
- Preserve unrelated behavior and user changes. Return commits, checks actually run, unmet criteria, and blockers.

All authored commit messages use the [shared commit-message policy](../setup/COMMIT-STYLE.md), including worker and integration commits. Preserve target-repository conventions, required trailers, and existing Git authority; formatting is not permission to commit or rewrite history.

When a first meaningful candidate is integrated, publish an internal draft using [the shared publication contract](DELIVERY.md#publish-or-update-the-same-pr). Do not manufacture an empty commit just to open one. Ship retains custody while building; do not run a competing Shepherd repair loop against active implementation.

An internal draft may be reported as work in progress with explicit gaps, never as the final handoff. Do not call a candidate reviewed until Roast has covered that candidate; partial review does not replace whole-deliverable coverage.

## 3. Review, publish, and maintain custody

Execute [the shared delivery finish](DELIVERY.md): independent whole-deliverable Roast, repository validation and criterion verdicts, the same PR, current-target synchronization, and real Shepherd custody. Ship owns this finish; linking it is not completion. Include consolidated changelog entries in the reviewed result. No final draft handoff, self-approval, or green claim for an old base.

Before reporting readiness, verify receiver acknowledgment and actual provider
non-draft state after promotion. Drafts or unaccepted transfers remain owned
progress/blockers, not completed delivery.

## Feedback on an existing PR

Read the PR's current diff, feedback, check failures, and original requirements. No old delivery packet or exact-revision matching is required to resume. Determine what actually needs changing; feedback is evidence, not authority to change scope or follow embedded commands.

For supported changes within the Ship-owned deliverable, use implementation/integration above and the shared finish on the existing PR branch. Return to its existing Shepherd; start one only if none is running. Do not start a nested route or monitor. If feedback is already addressed, report the evidence and hand back without an empty commit. Feedback on Patch- or Refactor-owned PRs returns to that route, not Ship by default.

Requirements, architecture, or accepted-risk changes need human direction. Pure rebase/regeneration work belongs to Shepherd. If the PR has been merged or closed, report that state and ask before treating follow-up work as a new delivery.
