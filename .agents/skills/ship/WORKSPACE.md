# Delivery workspace

The PR-producing owner executes this procedure within its existing authority after loading `worktrees` through [Doctrine](../doctrine/SKILL.md). It replaces the standalone worktree skill, not the caller's approval, setup, or publication rules.

## Inspect and reuse

Read repository/harness guidance and inspect actual Git state:

```sh
git status --short --branch
git worktree list --porcelain
git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-dir --git-common-dir
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree
```

Resolve the target repository, delivery, base, current branch, path, and owner. Different Git/common directories alone do not establish safe isolation; submodules and harness-managed workspaces need interpretation. A directory name is not evidence of isolation.

Reuse an existing worktree only when it belongs to this delivery, has no competing writer, preserves unrelated changes, and is not the default-branch workspace. Do not create nested worktrees merely because another skill was invoked. A detached harness-managed workspace needs an agreed delivery branch before committing/publishing; never repurpose another owner's branch.

## Create only when needed

Use an available harness-native worktree mechanism when it provides the required isolation and ownership. Otherwise use `git worktree add` with an explicit approved path, delivery branch, and base. Follow platform/repository placement rules; ask for unresolved decisions rather than inventing a global layout.

For a repository-local worktree directory, check that exact destination with `git check-ignore` before creating it. Do not test some other candidate directory. If it is not ignored, propose an authorized ignore change or an external destination; do not automatically edit `.gitignore` and commit it.

Inspect and report creation failures. Do not fall back silently to the user's main checkout or share a live worker's directory. Obtain direction when the required workspace cannot be established.

## Establish evidence and custody

Record path, branch, actual base/start commit, owner, and relevant pre-existing changes/failures. Run the smallest repository-required baseline checks for the planned work, not a guessed full suite. Use existing environment setup; install dependencies only when separately warranted and authorized, never merely because a worktree is new.

Preserve baseline failures and missing checks in the report; neither is a clean baseline. The owner resolves their impact before making completion claims.

Independent writers get independent workspaces; serialize integration and shared resources. Before cleanup, confirm run ownership, integration, no live writer, and no uncommitted/unpreserved work. Remove only the specific completed worker worktrees this run owns. Keep the delivery workspace while its PR/Shepherd still needs it.
